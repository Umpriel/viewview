# The Longest Line Of Sight

With the help of a custom-developed algorithm, [CacheTVS](https://github.com/AllTheLines/CacheTVS), we have exhaustively
checked _every_ line of sight on the planet in search for the coveted **longest line of sight**.
Under the conditions we detail [here](/faq/), there are none further. 

Each title heading links to a map to explore each line of sight, along with the rest of the world!

Without further ado, here are the top 5 longest lines of sight!

## [1. Hindu Kush to Pik Dankova](https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/78.76539611816406-36.31400680541992)
![Longest Line Of Site](/longest_line.webp 'The longest line of sight on the planet, from the Hindu Kush to Pik Dankova')

This is the current theorized the longest line of sight in the world, and it also happens
to be the longest line of sight our tool found! Since our tool is exhaustive, we know
its very likely a longer one will never be found!

## [2. Telkik Shan to Kongur Tagh](https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/80.29535675048828-36.52555465698242)
![Second Longest Line Of Site](/longest_line.webp 'The second longest line of sight, between the Telkik Shan and Kongur Tah')

Another long line of sight over the Tarim Basin and Tibetan Plateau. With such tall mountain
ranges on either side, they're everywhere!

## [3. Antioquia to Pico Cristobal](https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/-75.72223663330078-6.75514030456543)
![Third Longest Line Of Site](/longest_line.webp 'The third longest line of sight on the planet, Anioquia to Pico Crostobal')

On the other side of the world, we've found a line of sight from Pico Cristobal, the highest mountain in Colombia
to the Andes in the Colombian department of Antioquia.

## [4. Kunlunto to Nochnaya Babochka](https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/78.37439727783203-36.64704895019531)
![Fourth Longest Line Of Site](/longest_line.webp 'The fourth longest line of sight on the planet, Kunlunto to Nochnaya Babochka')

Back over to the Hindu mountain range, we've found another long line of sight over the Tarim Basin.


## [5. Hindu Kush to Tian Shan](https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/76.53218078613281-36.620765686035156)
![Fifth Longest Line Of Site](/longest_line.webp 'The longest line of sight on the planet, Hindu Kush to Tian Shan')

Finally, we have another Hindu Kush line of sight, this time much more interior to the Tibetan Plateau.
