# About Us

Tom and Ryan are two friends united behind a single problem: finding the longest line
of sight. Ryan met Tom through a tech forum, [HackerNews](https://news.ycombonator.com), 
after reaching out to recruit him for a company opening. They instantly clicked and have
kept in touch since.

Recently, Tom started working on an algorithm to find the longest line of sight,
and Ryan noticed it through a post on a tech forum explaining the project. For the last
6 months both have spent innumerous hours engineering [a tool](https://github.com/AllTheViews/CacheTVS) 
for the longest line of sight for every point on the planet, and to let others explore the beautiful world and all its
long lines of sight.

If you are interested in his [many](https://ryan.berge.rs/posts/lines-of-sight) [chronicles](https://ryan.berge.rs/posts/total-viewshed-algorithm/) about developing an algorithm for
the longest line of sight - or any of the other algorithmic shenanigans he gets up to -
you can read his blog at https://ryan.berge.rs/blog.
